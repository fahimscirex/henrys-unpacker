## Usage
- Download and unzip
- Place boot/system/vendor images to the directory where you extracted
- Open a terminal and type in ./henry
- Press 1 and press Enter. Make wanted changes inside system/vendor folders.
- Type in terminal ./henry and press 2 and press enter.
- You should have a rom.zip in the same directory which you can flash in TWRP.
If something goes wrong while unpacking make sure you have Python 3.6
